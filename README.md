# RpiGPIOAccess
A simple GPIO access wrapper class for the Raspberry Pi Model 2

This is a simple get- and set interface of the GPIO ports on the Raspberry Pi Model 2.

Included is a *NIX GPIO port simulator which can be used for developing and testing software using the GPIO ports without
using the Raspberry Pi hardware. The simulator uses shared memory and is currently supporting the simulation of two seperate
Raspberry Pi boards.
